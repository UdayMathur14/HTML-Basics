        this is main tag 
        <!-- inside the main tag we insert the following tags ::
        1) <section tag == is used for making a page section 
        2) <article> tag == a self contained content 
        3) <aside> tag == content aside from the main content 
         -->

    <footer>
        this is the footer tag 
    </footer>

    <!-- we can done all thi by using paragraph tag then why we do we use tag like 
    main,footer and header tag in the body because this is called a proper making website 
techinque , because if a robot see your website then he should know all about this 
, if we make website according to any random order then it will not be that good 
in the search engine and also it cannot be understand by the other people -->
